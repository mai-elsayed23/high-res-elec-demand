Other required input files include Excel files for the development of socioeconomic indicators under different scenarios, as well as historical figures for the correlation between electricity demand and income level.

For the Namibian illustrative case study, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways have been used for the projection of population and total gross domestic product (GDP) until 2050. Users are free to use other socioeconomic development scenarios as long as they follow the same format as the files attached here.

To derive the correlation between residential electricity demand and income level, historical figures for GDP per capita and electric power consumption per capita (all sectors) have been obtained from World Bank Data, while figures for total electricity consumption and residential electricity consumption have been obtained from the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Energy Statistics Data Browser. Further information about data sources can be found in the file's **Metadata** tab. Users are advised not to make any changes to this file.
