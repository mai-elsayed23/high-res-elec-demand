This workflow has been developed in Python.

All package requirements can be found in the **package_requirement.txt** file. Alternatively, they can also be found in the first cell of the main script.

All required input files can be found under the **inputs** folder. A separate README file can be found inside the folder describing the purpose and sources of each of the files. All files must be uploaded to the same workspace as the main script, so that it can run smoothly.

Namibia is used as an illustrative case study, but the script can be modified to model other countries/study regions.

Output maps and figures from the Namibian case study can be found under the **outputs_example** folder. Again, a separate README file can be found inside the folder describing the format and contents of each of the files.
